# Odin Flash
This is a flash card game created for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/top-jam-1).

## Synopsis
This game takes heavy inspiration from both Number Munchers and Tetris as well as my deep fondness for traditional flash cards. The goal is to match cards to the prompt by making as few mistakes as possible.
